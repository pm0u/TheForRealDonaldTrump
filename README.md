# TheForRealDonaldTrump

## An Explanation for an App that Needs No Explanation

This was one of my first react native apps. what it does:

- scrapes donald trumps tweets from 2009 (stored locally) and pulls tweets that have words related to the word confused (based on a list I found online)
- pulls the first 5 images from google image search for 'donald trump confused'
- randomly pairs these 2
- displays them on a fake instagram feed with random likes and random post time


## Future goals
- expand this to include other emotions or things like that -- such as angry, upset, pout, etc.. (images and tweets) 
- expand it to include a larger amount of tweets (I have locally stored all tweets from 2009-2017...)
- expand to include more images (this will require paginating the google image search results)
